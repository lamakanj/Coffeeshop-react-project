            <h2>Our Story</h2>
            <p>Moonlight Café was founded in 2015 by two lifelong friends passionate about coffee and community. We started as a pop-up and grew into a beloved neighborhood spot.</p>
            <p>Our mission is to create a space where people slow down, connect, and enjoy handcrafted drinks made with love.</p>
            <h2>Meet the Team</h2>
            <p>Our baristas are artists, students, and dreamers — trained in the art of espresso and latte foam hearts.</p>
